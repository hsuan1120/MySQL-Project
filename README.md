# MySQL-Project

## A. Project Goal
This project focuses on analyzing layoffs using MySQL. The work is divided into two major parts:

- Data cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis

## B. Data Cleaning
Main steps performed to improve data quality in MySQL.

- Remove duplicated records
- Handled blank/ NULL values
- Trimmed extra spaces and standatdized text formats
- Dropped irrelevant columns that were not required in analysis

The purpose of the stage was to ensure the dataset is reliable before aggregation  and trend analysis

## C. Exploratory Data Analysis
After cleaning the datasets, SQL queries were excuted to explore patterns such as:

- Total Layoffs by industry and company
- Total layoffs by time
- Calculate cumulative running layoffs over time
- Find the top 5 companies with the highest layoffs for each year
